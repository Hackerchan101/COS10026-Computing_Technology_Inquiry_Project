        <strong><em>Weekly quizzes</em></strong>: are short online quizzes completed at the beginning of your tutorial. See the
        Schedule above for the topics and dates of these quizzes. In general they cover the material
        from the previous lectures and are closed book.
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong><em>Lab exercises:</em></strong> in the tutorial your tutor will review the completion of your completed lab
        exercises. You are encourage to attempt to complete the set exercises before your tutorial so
        you have time to discuss any issues that arise with you tutor and have time to get them marked
        off.
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong><em>Assignments Parts 1, 2 and 3: </em></strong>are incremental instalments of a web site development task. In
        Part 1 you will demonstrate your ability to develop and deploy on a server well-structured, linked
        Web pages with text, graphics, tables and forms, styled with CSS. Part 2 further extends the
        use of HTML elements and makes use of JavaScript to validate forms and add dynamic
        behaviour to the Web page. In Part 3 you will use forms to submit and retrieve data from a
        server using PHP and MySQL.
